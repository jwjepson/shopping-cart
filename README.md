## Project Description: 
- This is a shopping cart application built with React and react-router-dom. The application allows users to browse products (Donuts), and add them to their cart. The goal of this project was to continue learning React, and to learn react-router-dom, so that users can navigate to multiple pages and the URL will adjust accordinly. 

## What I've learned:
- Using react-router-dom, and using BrowserRouter & Route in order to create unique webpages for each link in my navigation menu.
- Using hooks such as useState.
- Continued practice passing props between components, and creating reusable components.
- Continued practice updating state in components.
- Using the React Testing Library to write tests for my application.
- Using <Link/> on elements to navigate user to correct route.
- Continued practice with conditional rendering.
- Continued practice using flexbox and CSS Grid.
- Continued practice using map, reduce, filter methods to display data.


## Final Thoughts:
Overall, this shopping cart application was really fun to create and I'm very happy with the end result. It was really interesting learning how react-router-dom works and how to create multiple pages for my application. In addition, I feel as though this project really helped me solidify my understanding of React and I definitely feel more comfortable using React to create applications now. Furthmore, this was the first project where I started learning how to use React Testing Library in order to write tests for my code. Going forward, I would like to continue practicing with the React Testing Library and getting better with writing useful tests. Feel free to check out my project and give it a try!
